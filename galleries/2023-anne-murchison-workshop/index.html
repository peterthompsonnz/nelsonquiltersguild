    <p>
      On Saturday 9th September Anne Murchison, from Christchurch, ran an
      all-day workshop on how to use
      <strong>Whims Watercolor Quilt Kits</strong>. The kits are a type of
      quilting kit that includes pre-cut fabric pieces, instructions, and
      sometimes additional supplies like fusible fabric and a quilt grid. The
      kits come in a variety of styles and designs, such as the Hummingbird
      Kisses Quilt, Cactus Garden kit, Iris Garden Watercolor Quilt Kit, "Wreath
      Of Lilacs" Watercolor Quilt Kit, and the "With All My Heart" kit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kits are designed to make the quilting process easier and more
      accessible for beginners and experienced quilters alike. They often
      feature easy piecing and fusible appliqu√© techniques. Additionally, they
      offer a Quilt-Grid, a lightweight fusible fabric pre-marked in 2" squares
      for use with the graph found inside your kit, which speeds up the quilt
      making process. The kits can be purchased from the Whims website, Amazon,
      and other quilting supply retailers.
